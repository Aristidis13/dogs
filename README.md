# GlobalWebIndex Engineering Challenge

## Exercise: DogLover


Create an React application for dog lovers which is going to build upon https://dog.ceo/dog-api/ and will have 3 views. 


The application will include a header with 3 links, each link will point to the following 3 views: 


- The first view will display random dog images with the refered dog api

- The second view will display a list of dog breeds accompanied with a breed image.  This list will apply links to the third view. 

- The third view will display a list of images for a specific dog breed, including a header with the selected breed. 


Nice to have: Filtering dog breeds based on search input field. 



You can find the API documentation here: https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation 

We give you a lot of freedom in technologies and ways of doing things. We only insist on you using React.js with Typescript. 
Note that we have omitted a lot of details in this description which we hope you will fill in and thus prove to us that you are aware of industry best practices and that you also follow them. Get creative as much as you want, we WILL appreciate it. You will not be evaluated based on how well you follow these instructions, but based on how sensible your solution will be. In case you are not able to implement something you would normally implement for time reasons, make it clear with a comment.
